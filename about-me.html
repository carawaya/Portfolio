  <h2>Background Information</h2>
  <p>I grew up in the Midwest, and moved ot Seattle in 2008. My father moved our family to Seattle due to an amazing career opportunity with Microsoft. Now that we are in a place that is a hub for the tech industry, I thought I would take advantage of the opportunity to learn, and "develop" my skills.</p>
